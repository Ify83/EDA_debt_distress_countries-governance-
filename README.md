This project focuses on debt distress vulnerability classifications for thirty Sub-Saharan African countries that have been granted debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. At the turn of the century, heavily indebted countries (most of which were located in Sub-Saharan Africa) were granted large-scale cancellations of external debt owed to the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and African Development Bank. Since then, the debt sustainability of these countries has been closely monitored by the IMF and World Bank under the Debt Sustainability Analysis for Low Income Countries (DSA for LIC). This DSA has been conducted in Low-Income countries since 2005.This dataset contains the external debt distress classifications for 30 Sub-Saharan African countries that have been granted debt reductions under the HIPC scheme from 2005 to 2019. If there was no DSA conducted in a year, the DSA classification of the previous year is shown.
